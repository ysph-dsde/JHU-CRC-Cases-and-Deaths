# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

## About The Coffee, Cookie and Coding $\left(C^3\right)$ Workshops

Yale's Public Health Data Science and Data Equity (DSDE) team created this workshop series for Public Health and Biostatistics masters-level students at Yale. They are designed to help learners effectively leverage computational tools and analytical methods in their educational and professional endeavors. You can find out more about past and upcoming tutorials on our YouTube (coming soon) and [website](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/research-centers-and-initiatives/public-health-data-science-and-data-equity/events/).

## About Workshop

**Workshop Title:** &nbsp; Getting Started with Git and GitHub

**Date:** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; Monday November $4^{\text{th}}$, 2024

We will be launching our Coffee, Cookie and Coding $\left(C^3\right)$ workshop series with a starter guide on Git and GitHub. Upon completing the workshop, you will be able to:
- Identify the benefits of using Git and GitHub.
- Configure your local Git and personal GitHub accounts and set up their security keys.
- Share and contribute to projects with an example created in RStudio.

If you are affiliated with Yale, you can set up an office hour appointment with one of the data scientists ([Bookings Page](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DataScienceDataEquityOfficeHours@yale.edu/bookings/)).

## About Repository

There are two GitHub repositories associated with this workshop. The link to the second repository can be found here: [JHU-CRC-Vaccinations](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Vaccinations).

### Overview Of Contents

- **For the analysis:** `Analysis Script_Cases and Deaths Plot.R`
- **R version:** 4.4.1
- ``renv`` is included to reproduce the environment.

## Using this Repository

### Making a Clean-Break Copy

The repository needs to be copied into your personal GitHub for the workshop in a manner that will decouple its operations from this original repository. Please use one of the following two methods to do this.

**METHOD 1:** Copying Using GitHub Importer

**NOTE:** This method is not a Fork. You can learn more about GitHub Importer [here](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-github-importer/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer).

1. Under the "Repositories" tab of your personal GitHub page, selecte the "New" button in the top-right corner. This will start the process of starting a new repository.

2. At the top of the page is a hyperlink to import a repository. Open that link ([GitHub Importer](https://github.com/new/import)).

3. Paste the URL of this repository when prompted. No credentials are required for this action.

4. Adjust the GitHub account owner as needed and create the name for the new repository. We recommend initially setting the repository to Private.

5. Proceed with cloning the newly copied repository.

**METHOD 2:** Copying Using Terminal

These directions follow GitHub's [duplicating a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) page.

1. [Create a new](https://github.com/new) GitHub repository ([Further documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)).
   
   **NOTE:** Do not use a template or include a description, README file, .gitignore, or license. Only adjust the GitHub account owner as needed and create the name for the new repository. We recommend initially setting the repository to Private.
   
2. Open Terminal.

3. Navigate to the file location you want to store the repository copy.
   ```
   cd "/file_location/"
   ```

4. Clone a bare copy of the repository.
   ```
   # using SSH
   git clone --bare git@github.com:ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths.git 
   
   # or using HTTPS
   git clone --bare https://github.com/ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths.git 
   ```
   
5. Open the project file.
   ```
   cd JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths.git 
   ```
   
6. Push a mirror of the cloned Git file to your newly created GitHub repository.
   ```
   # using SSH
   git push --mirror git@github.com:EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git

   # or using HTTPS
   git push --mirror https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
   ```

7. Delete the bare cloned file used to create a new remote repository.
   ```
   cd ..                                    # Go back one file location
   rm -rf JHU-CRC-Vaccinations.git          # Delete the bare clone
   ```
8. Proceed with cloning the newly copied repository.

### Cloning the Copied Repository

Now that you have copied this repository into your own GitHub, you are ready to proceed with a standard clone to your local device.
  
1. Open Terminal.

2. Navigate to the file location you want to store the repository copy.
   ```
   cd "/file_location/"
   ```
3. Clone the newly created GitHub repository.
   ```
   # using SSH
   git clone git@github.com:EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git

   # or using HTTPS
   git clone https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
   ```

4. **OPTIONAL:** You can reset the repository history, which will clear the previous commits, by running the following block of code (Source: [StackExchange by Zeelot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9683279/make-the-current-commit-the-only-initial-commit-in-a-git-repository)).
    
    ```
    git checkout --orphan tempBranch         # Create a temporary branch
    git add -A                               # Add all files and commit them
    git commit -m "Reset the repo"
    git branch -D main                       # Deletes the main branch
    git branch -m main                       # Rename the current branch to main
    git push -f origin main                  # Force push main branch to GitHub
    git gc --aggressive --prune=all          # Remove the old files
    ```

### Initializing the Environment

1. Open the newly cloned file.
2. Launch the project by opening `JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths.Rproj`.
3. Open `Analysis Script_Cases and Deaths Plot.R`.
4. In the R console, activate the environment by running:
    ```
    renv::restore()
    ```

   **NOTE:** You may need to run ``renv::restore()`` twice to initialize and install all the packages listed in the lockfile. Follow the prompts that comes up and accept installation of all packages. You are ready to proceed when running ``renv::restore()`` gives the output ``- The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.``. You can read more about ``renv()`` in their [vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

## About Original Data Source

The [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) (JHU CRC) tracked and compiled global COVID-19 pandemic data from January 22, 2020 and March 10, 2023. 
These data are publicly available through their two GitHub repositories. We imported cumulative case and death counts for the U.S. from their [CSSE GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
